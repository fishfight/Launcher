You can use it by going to the \"Settings\" menu in the game, clicking the \"Networking\" tab, and setting the matchmaking server to `spicy-lobster.katharostech.com:65534` ( this address will change in the future ).\r\n\r\nIf you use the SpicyLauncher, you can update the developer version if it changes by uninstalling it, and re-installing it."
